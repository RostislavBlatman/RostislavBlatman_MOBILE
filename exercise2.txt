1.	Setup project that has been discussed in the class. Make sure you can run both tests (native and web) successfully.
	>> Done.
2.	For existing native mobile autotest try to use another locator (xpath, classname, ?). Define these locators using Appium Inspector. Are there any difference with id version?
	>> Difference in lenght of locators. And xpath more reliable.
3.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
	>> I should change device name from emulator-5554 to device serial number. 
4.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests. Are there any difference with run on emulator?
	>> You can touch it and get experience with a real device.
5.	What should be improved/changed in existing test code? Why, for what?
	>> Avoid using hard coded values for avoid problems with run on another environment;
	   Avoid using thread sleep to reduce testing time;
	   Write real test cases;
	   Write the code in such a way that there is no need to comment on certain lines.
